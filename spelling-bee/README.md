# Spelling Bee

This game is based on the New York Times game [_Spelling Bee_](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/26/crosswords/spelling-bee-forum-introduction.html). 

The basic premise of the game is that you are provided a set of 7 letters.
Of those 7 letters there is a singular letter which is required to be used 
placed in the center of a hive grid and highlighted yellow. 
The objective of the game is to produce all possible 4+ letter words using 
the set of 7 letters.

Below I've included the rules and description of the game as told by NTY themselves. 
For the most part, the game included here covers the same set of rules.
One current key difference is the word list, which currently is sourced from the 2019 scrabble word dictionary and 
has a much deeper word set than what is used by the NTY.

### NYT: How to Read Doug's Grid

In every edition of the Spelling Bee Forum, there is a grid made by Doug Mennella. 
It can be intimidating if you‚Äôve never seen it before, but it‚Äôs a very useful tool once you know how to use it.

Here‚Äôs an example:

```
     4   5   6   7   8   10  11  Œ£
B:   6   2   7   1   -   -   -   16
E:   -   1   1   2   -   1   1   6
L:   2   2   -   -   -   -   -   4
M:   6   4   5   1   1   -   -   17
N:   1   1   1   -   -   -   -   3
O:   1   -   1   -   1   -   -   3
T:   12  4   2   -   1   -   -   19
Œ£:   28  14  17  4   3   1   1   68
```

The grid is a distribution of the number of words that contain a certain number of letters. 
The sigma (ùõ¥) symbols are an abbreviation of the word ‚Äútotal.‚Äù 
The left column refers to the beginning letter of a word, and the top row refers to the number of letters in a word. 
For example, there are a total of 16 words beginning with the letter ‚ÄúB,‚Äù and six of them are four letters long.
